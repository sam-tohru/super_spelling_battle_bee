# super_spelling_battle_bee
 A Word / Spelling Auto-Battler Game I made in Godot 4 
This is the new version (as opposed to the jam version) license not on this right now, can't be used, is a private repo, but this might change 
<br>
I'm just writing stuff here to puff out the github activity lol
<br>
But from 11-8, I've re-made the board sprites, well re-made it all from the jam mostly, but now I need to add some currency system for buying letters/refresh (maybe bet if you'll win? idk), and i need some gameplay-loop progression planned out, like scene to scene (is it progressive based on round like S.A.P or like the original super spelling battle bee and all can appear in a round [maybe cost??]). I also want items/buffs for letters and such (items in S.A.P)
